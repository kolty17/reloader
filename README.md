Use git clone inside the root of your project or download the zip and unzip inside your root folder, the important thing is that the folder "reloader" is inside your "addons" folder.

On activating the plugin in your project a new panel will appear on the bottom right with a text field and a button.

Write the name of your plugin in the field (the name of the plugin needs to be the same as the name of the plugin folder), on button press the plugin will be disabled and enabled.

Enjoy.
